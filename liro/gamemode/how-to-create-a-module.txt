- How to create a module

1. Create a folder within 'modules' directory with your modulename. The name may contain no spaces, and preferably no special characters or uppercase characters.
2. Copy the registermodule.lua from here https://github.com/Alydus/liro/blob/master/liro/gamemode/modules/examplemodule/registermodule.lua and put it into your module folder.
3. Configure the metadata within registermodule.lua (Required: folderName, loadPriority, author, description, website, version - Optional: networkStrings, loadPrefixes).
4. Create any lua files within any folders in the module you create, containing any code and they will be loaded.

It's recommended you read the facepunch thread for more information on developer hooks, e.g. running code when the entire module has been loaded (included).
