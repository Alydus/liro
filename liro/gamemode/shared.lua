-- Change these to your gamemodes information, feel free to remove credit for Liro if you wish.
-- GM.Name will display as the gamemode name in the new server browser.
-- GM.Version should not be changed, as this is used as an internal versioning system for Liro and it's version checker.
-- If you want to have a version for your gamemode, please include it somewhere else, or create a different version variable (e.g. GM.ContentVersion)
-- The foldername of your gamemode will determine which server gamemode category it is in, common ones are ttt, darkrp or starwarsrp.
