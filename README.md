# What is Liro?
Liro is a modular Garry's Mod gamemode base. It has been designed from the ground up for code reusability and ease of use.

# Features
* A optimized **recursive module loader** and clean output load logs
* Global functions that can be reused from the Liro base files
* No messing about with include() and AddCSLuaFile()
* **Example modules** to help developers get started
* Configurable file prefixes (per module & global) for running files in different enviroments (e.g. sh_, sv_, cl_)
* Ability to **disable/enable modules** in the base config. (gamemode/liro/config.lua)
* All code is mostly all **fully commented**, meaning the code is easy to contribute to and modify to your own needs
